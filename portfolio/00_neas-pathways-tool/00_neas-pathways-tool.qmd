## About this project

This project, an interactive data tool with data from the National Education and Attainment Survey (NEAS), allows users to explore NEAS data along three main topics. Visitors can:

1.  View trajectories of subgroups of U.S. adults through milestones in educational attainment and employment,

2.  Compare career and educational attainment outcomes across demographic groups,

3.  Explore the demographic distributions of those who obtain post-secondary certificates and those who do not.

## Who was involved

This project was built by me and the incredible [Will Bonnell](https://www.willdebras.dev/){target="_blank"} and [Shalima Zalsha](https://norc.org/about/experts/shalima-zalsha.html){target="_blank"}, with oversight and design feedback by [Nola du Toit](https://www.norc.org/about/experts/nola-du-toit.html){target="_blank"}.

Will made the really cool 'game board' on the home page and did a lot of the site styling, including the characteristics selector on the 'Trajectories' page, which was one of my first intros to `shinyjs`. Shalima lead the development of the beautiful `plotly`-based graphics on the 'Certificate Attainment' page.

#### My role

Will and I worked the parallel sets diagrams together, and I did a lot of the site styling and layout. This was one of my first projects where I had to start learning CSS and how to style a Shiny site; I learned a ton throughout the process.

## Tools used

The whole site is a `shiny` application. We used `r2d3` for the D3-based parallel sets diagrams.
