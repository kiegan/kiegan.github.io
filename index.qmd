# Welcome.

Hi, I'm Kiegan! 

![](www/kiegan-headshot-hex.png){fig-alt='Photo of Kiegan in the shape of a hexagon.' width='20em' }

I'm a Statistician specializing in static and interactive data visualization, computational reproducibility, and scientific communication. I believe that data-driven decision making can have a hugely positive impact on the world, particularly when those decisions inform policy. 


### Current Role

I am a Senior Statistican in the Statistics and Data Science department at NORC at the University of Chicago. I work on projects in higher education, public health, and health care. You can find out more about what I do [on NORC's website](https://norc.org/about/experts/kiegan-rice.html){target='_blank'}.

### Education 

I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from Iowa State University in 2020, working with [Dr. Heike Hofmann](https://github.com/heike){target='_blank'} and [Dr. Ulrike Genschel](http://ugenschel.github.io/){target='_blank'}. My primary research topic was computational and statistical reproducibility of data science pipelines. I previously earned an M.S. in Statistics from Iowa State University and a B.A. in Mathematics and Spanish from St. Olaf College.

## I build tools to help people explore data and social science research.

Bringing data to the public in a user-friendly way is an important part of modern data communication. I use a mix of tools (with R as my home base) to create interactive graphics and websites exploring social science and public policy data.

## I study data visualization design and reproducibility in scientific research. 

Understanding how users view, interact with, and interpret data visualizations is a key part of effective data communication. One of my key research areas is studying how elements of data visualization design impact a viewer's perception and interpretation of a chart or graphic. 

Ensuring reproducibility in scientific research is critical to building a robust, reliable, and trustworthy body of scientific literature. Whenever code is applied to data to complete a task, it is important to document the steps taken, how and why those steps were taken, and the environment in which those steps were taken. I study reproducibility over time in research that uses open-source software, primarily R.
