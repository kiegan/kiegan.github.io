## Who was involved

This work was jointly authored by myself and Dr. Heike Hofmann. 

## Abstract

Achieving computational reproducibility within data science pipelines is a dynamic, shifting task. Package development for data science is happening at a very rapid speed, both in R and python, the two main scripting languages for Data Science. This means, that an implemented data pipeline might produce different results due to a change in the underlying dependencies. Focusing on the R software we propose a paradigm for managing computational reproducibility that assists users in not only identifying when a package's functionality has changed, but also identifies whether that change will impact the results of a user's project code.

## About this product

This is an abbreviated version of one of my dissertation chapters on computational reproducibility. This work was presented at the [Symposium on Data Science and Statistics (SDSS)](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/sdss/2020/onlineprogram/AbstractDetails.cfm?AbstractID=308383){target='_blank'} in 2020.
